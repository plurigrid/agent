# A scientist’s opinion: Interview with Emilia Gómez on AI in music

on August 31, 2022

**[Emilia Gómez](https://emiliagomez.com/about/)** is a senior researcher at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission in Sevilla and a guest professor of the Department of Information and Communication Technologies at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona.

---

In recent years you worked on two large European projects that investigated AI to analyse music: PHENICX and TROMPA. Both of them are finished. What were they about?

**Emilia Gómez**: In PHENICX we created an app that gave the user access to information about Beethoven’s third symphony, called Eroica, both before, during and after the concert. The idea behind the app was that it would make complex classical music more accessible for audiences that are not so familiar with classical music. The app would help for example to find patterns in the symphony, or find out how a theme is played by different instruments.

TROMPA was a more recent Horizon2020-project in which we built and enriched public-domain musical databases by combining human and artificial intelligence. We enhanced musical scores and brought them into the public domain. We focused on five different communities: choir singers, orchestras, musicologists, piano players and music enthusiasts. For each community we created some web based application where people could benefit from and contribute to repertoire in the public domain.

---

What is the impact that AI is already having on music professionals?

**Emilia Gómez**: At the moment AI-tools have the potential to support the learning process of musicians. Piano players or choir singers can record their rehearsals or concerts and let the AI-tool compare them. Music teachers can use AI to analyse the achievements of their students. Musicologists can use these techniques to learn about music in a different way. Composers can use them for inspiration or to locate certain material that they want to use.

AI also has some risks that we need to address. For instance, imagine that an AI system is used to evaluate music students in exams. We then need to make sure this system is, for instance, fair and transparent. This is in line with the EU approach towards trustworthy AI.

---

What are some grand challenges in your field?

**Emilia Gómez**: For pieces of music that are complex, such as symphonic music or choir music, the transcription from audio to score is still a big challenge for AI. Another challenge is, when an AI-tool is given a certain song, to find another song that is similar. Basically we still do not have a good definition of what it means that two songs are similar. And then there is the challenge of automatically separating different instruments from any piece of music.

---

Will there come a time that AI captures all the aspects of music in the way humans do?

**Emilia Gómez**: I find it important to realise that music is not just ‘any kind of data’, as some people think. There are many aspects of music that lie beyond the data itself, such as culture and emotion. Music is much more than the acoustic signal and it is much more connected to emotion than language, for example. To integrate culture and emotion in the analysis of music is very hard for a machine.

## Misc.

I wrote my PhD manuscript on the [Optimization of Fast Deep Learning Network for Audio Analysis and Synthesis](https://ai.honu.io/misc/Deep%20learning%20networks%20for%20audio%20analysis%20and%20synthesis.pdf). Half of it is on audio synthesis and source separation, and the other half is on adaptive and stochastic optimization.


## ∈
The symbol ∈ **indicates set membership and means “is an element of”** so that the statement x∈A means that x is an element of the set A. In other words, x is one of the objects in the collection of (possibly many) objects in the set A.

### Whose Memories?

http://guillaumeslizewicz.com/posts/2020/i_can_remember/

The piece has three main layers of memories: the most obvious is the personal one, highlighted by the location of the shooting and the data that is based on. The second, still visible, is the memories of the algorithms, the labels and words embedded inside them. The third, often unaccounted for is the memory of the people who are part of the dataset, the one that has been extracted to create algorithms.


#### Local

This piece has been made in a rural area. The photograph that constitute the dataset document the landscape and daily life there. These photographs are the one used to create the poems. They are the images, the instants kept of this moment, and with years, memory will start erasing all the rest. Photograph are totems for invoking recessing feelings of past times. They are the memories that remain: partial, biased and framed.

By putting the poems back into the place they were “inspired” by, It might convey a little more of the place and show what translation errors algorithms have made.


![[../Media/Pasted image 20220930131111.png]]

### Poem Generation

In order to create poems from the photos, I used two main external tools: google vision API and Color summarizer by Martin Krzywinski. These two algorithms, when used with the photograph dataset, produced two distinct vocabularies: labels and colour descriptions. These two vocabularies were subsequently merged via tracery, a python tool, to create the poem. The process is described below.

## Claude Shannon 

# Claude Shannon, "Father of Information Theory," Celebrated at Bell Labs

Two hundred and fifty information theorists, scientists, engineers and researchers from around the world converged at Nokia Bell Labs in Murray Hill last Thursday and Friday to celebrate the centennial of mathematician Claude Shannon (born April 30, 1916, in Petoskey, Michigan.) [Shannon](https://www.bell-labs.com/claude-shannon/) authored a sensational and game-changing 1948 paper, _“A Mathematical Theory of Communication,”_ proposing that data from any kind of message—whether audio, video, or text—could be reduced to “bits” of information (“bit,” a contraction of “binary” and “digital,“ was attributed by Shannon to a colleague, John Tukey.)  Shannon suggested that measurable bits of information could be captured “digitally,” and that data transmissions were governed by laws and principles related to the source, signal, capacity of the transmitter, and “noise” or interference during transmission.   As author Jon Gertner wrote in _The Idea Factory,_ "mathematicians would debate not whether Shannon was ahead of his contemporaries..., [but] whether he was twenty, or thirty, or fifty years ahead." 

The Nokia Bell Labs conference entitled, "[The Future of the Information Age](https://www.bell-labs.com/claude-shannon/)", opened with a rich sequence of talks by _Irwin Jacobs_ (who co-founded Qualcomm in 1985 with no financing, no business plan, and no product), _Robert Metcalfe_ (inventor of Ethernet in 1973 and founder of 3Com Corporation, _Eric Schmidt_ (Executive Chairman of Alphabet Inc., which encompasses Google Inc.), _Amber Case_ (“cyborg anthropologist” and user experience designer), and _Henry Markram_ (neuroscientist and founder of the Blue Brain Project focused on algorithmic "reconstruction and simulation of the brain on supercomputers").

Afternoon research demonstrations and a technology showcase highlighted topics such as augmented intelligence, robotic animation and collaboration, autonomous vehicles, “zero-touch clouds,” and the future digital fabric integrating “smart” cities with rural living. 

A dazzling half-hour compression of Shannon's work by Vincent Poor, Dean of Princeton University's School of Engineering and Applied Science, and Michelle Effros, Professor of Electrical Engineering at California Institute of Technology on Friday dramatized his impact.  

Using a tag-team approach, the pair recounted in 2-minute segments Shannon's astounding accomplishments in 9 areas of inquiry: 

-     Capacity
-     Multi-user Channels
-     Channel Coding
-     Detection and Hypothesis Testing
-     Source Coding
-     Learning and Big Data
-     Complexity and Combinatorics
-     Cybersecurity
-     Applications of information theory beyond the traditional communications realm.

Today, seven decades later, research in all of these areas can be traced directly to Claude Shannon's visionary insights developed amidst the interdisciplinary culture of Bell Labs.  

Though aspects of the Conference pointed to a utopian future of humankind made ever-smarter and more effective by total information access and connectivity, anthropologist and tech designer Amber Case's talk on "Designing Calm Technology" offered a refreshingly contrarian view.  She sees the oft-cited "50 billion devices online by 2020" as a nightmare scenario, and shudders at the incessant beeps and bleeps in the "Dystopian Kitchen of the Future" designed by techies who "haven't read history" and "have no idea how things really work."

Case regrets our current cacophony of interruptive tools.  She argues that well-designed technology will demand just _some_ of our attention, _only when necessary_, and that designers should focus on the task and desired results, rather than the gadgets themselves.  "You shouldn't be a systems engineer to live in your own home," she claims.

Those of us concerned by the under-branding of humanities should be buoyed by Case's personal thoughts shared backstage after her talk.   She was raised without TV (both parents were in broadcasting and wanted a break when at home), with World Book encyclopedia, Plato's dialogues, and Scott Joplin rags close at hand.  When leaning toward attending MIT or Caltech, her Math professor implored her to "go to a liberal arts college where they teach you how to think." Case majored in Anthropology at Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Oregon, and is now a “user experience designer” working to optimize the interaction of humans, computers, creative culture, design, and our societal goals. Explore her ideas at [CaseOrganic.com](http://caseorganic.com/).
