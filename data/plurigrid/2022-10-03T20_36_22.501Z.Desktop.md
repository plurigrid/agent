The Blockchain Socialist: Aligning DAOs and Cybernetics (55 min)
https://theblockchainsocialist.com/aligning-daos-and-cybernetics/ 

For this episode I spoke to Kelsie Nabben (@kelsiemvn), a qualitative researcher on resilience in decentralised technologies and governance at RMIT in Australia. She recently co-wrote a piece titled Aligning the concept of ‘Decentralized Autonomous Organization’ to Precedents in Cybernetics with Michael [[@Zargham]] whom you may know from a previous episode. Kelsie also publishes on her Substack about  decentralised digital infrastructure, security, and society.

During the interview we spoke about her previous work in one of the first crypto applications to do an ICO in Australia, her switch to academia to study decentralised systems more closely, and how cybernetics can be used as a framework for understanding and designing DAOs. The article she co-wrote is probably one of the most interesting pieces I’ve read on DAOs and highly encourage people to check it out!

@kelsiemvn on how she found second-order cybernetics and anthropology as relevant frames for understanding crypto systems to keep in mind the designer of these systems.

The article she co-wrote with @mZargham is probably one of the most interesting pieces I’ve read on DAOs and highly encourage people to check it out!

# Aligning the concept of ‘Decentralized Autonomous Organization’ to Precedents in Cybernetics

# A research paper…

_Kelsie Nabben, providing a brief introduction to:_

_Zargham, Michael and Nabben, Kelsie, Aligning ‘Decentralized Autonomous Organization’ to Precedents in Cybernetics (April 4, 2022). Available at SSRN:_ [_https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4077358_](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4077358)

_April, 2022._

When I first came across the fact that the term “Decentralized Autonomous Organization” had existed at least since 1997 in my research, I was stunned. Where? Why? And why is no one talking about this?

It turns out that a German computer scientist had used the phrase Decentralized Autonomous Organization” to describe an “intelligent” home system that operated like an immune system in “identifying, defining, and maintaining the self” to “cooperate with other agents by sending messages and interpreting incoming messages such that the whole system fulfils the task it is designed for” (Dilger, 1997).

This approach to thinking about purpose oriented, self-organizing, multi-agent systems comes out of the field of Cybernetics. The term cybernetics stems from the Greek word “kubernetes” meaning “steersman” or “governor”. It is a science of computational augmentation and organization, out of which Information Theory, Control Theory and Control Systems Engineering grew into independent disciplines (Heylighen and Joslyn, 2001).

So, are the principles of control theory and multi-agent, purpose driven organization systems relevant to blockchain technology and communities today? Well, Michael [Zargham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyNvoYuSFII) from BlockScience claims that Web3.0 is the “re-birth of cybernetics”.

Figure 1. (Zargham and Nabben, 2022)

To further explore how cybernetic principles apply to decentralized governance, Zargham and I co-wrote a paper (which I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to participate in). The abstract and link are as follows:

**Abstract:**

> _“_The concept of “Decentralized Autonomous Organization” has been popularized as part of the “Web 3.0” movement. This movement is characterized by digital infrastructures that are ‘decentralized’ in network architecture and permissionless to use. Decentralized autonomous organizations, referred to as DAOs, are a digital expression of the political will to self-organize. The granular entanglement of social and technical concepts makes it challenging to identify a historical precedent for DAOs. Yet, literature review and analysis reveals that this particular entanglement of information systems and self-organization is consistent with longstanding conceptual development and practice in the field of cybernetics. Drawing on Stafford Beer’s Viable Systems Model, this piece bridges DAOs and cybernetics via two main principles of organization: viability and purpose. Viability is a property of a system such that it has sufficient adaptive capacity to thrive in the face of change; adaptive capacity is characterized according to Ross Ashby’s concept of ‘variety’. Purpose is the ability to define and collectively pursue a goal in the sense of feedback control systems. Building on the control theoretic concepts of observability, controllability, and reachability, we examine the ‘governance surface’ of an organization and the associated trade-offs between resilience and robustness that emerge in governance surface design. We propose that this trade-off can be addressed with a constitutional archetype whereby an organization’s ability to update its code is constrained but not eliminated. A case study from a DAO known as ‘1Hive’ is explored to demonstrate this archetype in action. We consider the limitations of the cybernetics perspective by emphasizing the subjectivity of the governance designer. Finally, we conclude with future research directions_.”_

What I found particularly interesting in this exploration is the _increasing_ relevance of ethnography as a second-order feedback loop in the design and maintenance of systems.

Interesting how everyone here has a deep knowledge of math, as if it is this shared language -- but they all come to it from different complexity regions. Zargham in terms of control systems. Primavera in terms of Ontologies.

Polycentricity is **a complex**. **system of powers, incentives, rules, values, and individual attitudes com-** **bined in a complex system of relationships at different levels**. Even more. important, one may detect a very interesting dynamics at work.

Aligica & Tarko: Polycentritiy Concepts 
1. Multiplicity of decision centers 
2. active exercise of different opinions 
3. autonomous decision-making layers 
4. common/shared goals 

Institutional and cultural framework that provides the overarching system of rules 
1. territory-based or superimposing jurisdiction of decision centers 
2. rules seen as useful by decision centers 
3. nature of the collective choice aggregating mechanisms (market, consensus, or r majority rule) 
4. the framework helps us identify between insiders (subjected to the same system or rile subjected to the same system of rules)
5. 
The spontaneous order generated by evolutionary competition decision center's ideas 
1. Free exit 
2. relevant infroamton for decsion-making iss public or secret 
3. entry is either free, or spontanous (no decsion innvolved - it happens naturally) 

"**Polycentric** is an English adjective, meaning "having more than one center," derived from the Greek words _polús_ ("many") and _kentrikós_ ("center"). **Polycentricism** (or **polycentricity**) is the abstract noun formed from polycentric. They may refer to:

-   [Polycentric law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycentric_law "Polycentric law"), a legal structure in which providers of legal systems compete or overlap in a given jurisdiction"

# Categorical cybernetics: A manifesto

Posted on [Nov 27, 2019](https://julesh.com/2019/11/27/categorical-cybernetics-a-manifesto/) by [juleshedges](https://julesh.com/author/juleshedges/)

I suddenly became obsessed with cybernetics (exactly) 2 weeks ago when I learned what the word actually means, closely followed by this tweet bring my attention to the following line from the beginning of Kenneth Boulding’s classic (1956) paper General Systems Theory: “The developments of a mathematics of quality and structure is already on the way, even though it is not as far advanced as the “classical” mathematics of quantity and number.” Which sounds like category theory to me. (I think it’s extremely unlikely Boulding had category theory in mind – Eilenberg and Mac Lane’s General Theory of Natural Equivalences was published in 1945; for comparison the first textbook on graph theory was published in 1936.)


“Cybernetics” is a very slippery term to pin down, and can mean whatever the writer wants it to mean, something it has in common with its superior officer, General Systems Theory. But for this purpose I’m going to pick a definition: cybernetics is the control theory of complex systems. It was characterised by being extremely interdisciplinary, and in the West ventured a lot into pseudo-scientific discussions of consciousness. My understanding is that historically it aimed far too high, missed its goals spectacularly, and has been living an unfashionable death ever since. (In the time since, the word cyber has been repurposed for a lot of unrelated things, so I’m conflicted between thinking recovering the name is a lost cause, and wanting to recover such an inherently cool name.)

With this definition, plus the reasonable handwave of seeing compositionality of open systems as being about complex systems, which is to say a complex of open systems linked together. To some extent all of applied monoidal categories is about this (including categorical quantum mechanics, which is about open quantum-mechanical systems), with decorated cospans as the sledgehammer in the toolbox of “categorical systems theory”.

With this, there is certainly existing work in applied category theory that could reasonably be called “categorical cybernetics”. The most obvious is Categories In Control. The series of work by Bonchi, Sobocinski and Zanasi on linear relations (for example this and this), also have quite a control-theoretic flavour.

Then there are things where open systems do optimisation. My own compositional game theory is probably the biggest example of this done with categories.

Compositional game theory belongs to an emerging common pattern of things that look a bit like lenses if you squint a bit. Also here can be found backpropagation (also this) the Kalman filter, and reinforcement learning (I have unpublished notes on reinforcement learning with open games, and I’ll come back to it). There are plenty of other things that look a bit like lenses if you squint a bit, but these are the cybernetic ones.

I just remembered that I promised a manifesto, not a literature review. Here is my manifesto: Categorical cybernetics (or CyberCat, to go with DisCoCat) should be identified as a subfield of applied category theory, and a rich source of applications for categorical methods. That’s all I’ve got. (It’s possible I’m not a natural at manifesto-writing.)

@comandingo wrote on Twitter:
> “Joseph Goguen did work together with Francisco Varela and referenced the book “The Tree of Knowledge” in his “Categorical Manifesto”. Varela contributed to the development of the cybernetic epistemology called “radical constructivism”. (which is also part of this story IMHO)”

# Evil Exititutions! 

We had a big discussion about evil in extituions! 

# Cool Realization!
Realized that at DWebCamp I met Paul Lindner, who was one of the creators of Gopher protocol! 

I'm very interested in these alternate histories of the web. What would've happened if Gopher won out? And how these teams win or do now.

The Rise And Fall Of The Gopher Protocol
Twenty-five years ago, a small band of programmers from the University of Minnesota ruled the internet. And then they didn’t.
August 21, 2016

https://tcbmag.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-gopher-protocol/

"The programmers were young guys, mostly in their 20s and, like McCahill, mostly huge Nirvana fans. Paul Lindner, a coding wunderkind from northern Minnesota who was dubbed the Gopher Dude for his evangelism, had long metal-head hair and signed Gopher emails with lyrics like “You have to spit to see the shine” from Babes in Toyland. Early Gopher servers were named Mudhoney, Danzig, and Anthrax. The sole outlier in the microcomputer mosh pit was Bob Alberti, a programmer who named a server Indigo, as in the Indigo Girls."

**Why did Gopher Fail?** 
Pure Technology. One common explanation of Gopher's demise is that it does not support hypertext, which is what the Internet really should be providing. Without hyperlinks, this argument goes, Gopher is little more than an electronic filing system. The Web, on the other hand, makes great use of hypertext.

Where Have all the Gophers Gone? Why the Web beat Gopher in the ...

"What was different between gopher and the WWW?

**Gopher is a largely superseded text-only precursor to the web**. It allows you to view plain text available on servers around the world."

Back in the early 1990s, before there was a World Wide Web, there was the Internet Gopher. It was a distributed information system in the same sense as the web, but didn’t use hypertext and was text-based. Gopher was popular back then, as it made it easy to hop from one server to the next in a way that FTP didn’t.
