## A Plural Decentralized Identity Frontier: Abstraction v. Composability Tradeoffs in Web3 ✵
[[../World/Gesellschaft/Shrey Jain]] [[../World/Gesellschaft/Leon Erichsen]] [[../World/Gesellschaft/Glen Weyl]]
Who is web3? The traveling couple or group? Let’s consider both sides. On the one hand, one could argue that the traveling couple are analogous to the novel, rapid, pivoting experiments running in small web3 communities, and the group vacation is what web3 becomes with adoption of 'standards.'' Given web3’s nascency, it is impossible to know in advance if these standards would satisfy the changing needs and preferences of the couple. In particular, given that the web3 ecosystem has strong values against surveillance and censorship, continued experimentation on approaches is worthwhile, especially since web3 contains minimal sensitive identity data (healthcare, government, insurance). Settling for a local maxima identity standard out of convenience risks adopting a solution that stunts and limits web3's innovation potential—possibly by orders of magnitude. Image 2 from Mignano’s blog shows the innovation ceiling hit with prematurely adopting standards.

On the other hand, an argument favoring adopting standards early on is that they can yield positive externalities. The more parties that adopt a standard, the greater coordination and network effect. As Mignano notes, standards create a “common language for how products can interact with other products, eliminating the need to build each component within a market or re-define how systems communicate with each other.” And it is vital that we eventually build some consensus on how to approach a problem. For example, thanks to TCP / IP (1970s), SMTP (1980s), RSS (1999), and FHIR (2011), we can benefit from a rich ecosystem on the internet of mail, podcasts, and information. We argue a third way. As noted by the initial draft dates of each of these standards, it can take years of iteration of an initial specification before becoming a widely adopted standard. For example, the FHIR specification—initially drafted in 2011—is only now reaching global adoption. We argue identity standards are sufficiently under-specified today, enabling innovation and expansion across various architecturals substrates; we are still early
